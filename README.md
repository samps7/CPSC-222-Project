# CPSC-222-Project
#### by Samuel Sovi

This is my Quantified Self Project for my CPSC 222 Intro to Data Science class. This project has some of my discord usage data as well as some weather data of my home town provided by the Meteostat API. I used these datasets to try and draw a conclusion on whether or not there was a relationship between my discord usage and the weather outside. 

## Running instructions
simply open project.ipynb

Note: data collection and cleaning are no longer done at runtime, so there are no extra steps to worry about
